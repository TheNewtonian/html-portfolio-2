<h1>The Best Anime Series According to Pasteur</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime series of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>
    Such a perfect anime and a huge success in the shonen genre
    of anime. All over the world, it is one of the most classic
    examples of what anime should be and has become an
    inspiration for numerous anime series. It has always been
    considered as the best for anime beginners.

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK)</h3>
<p>
    If you're a fan of action-packed anime, then I'd
    recommend watching it. The storyline and plot 
    are crazy while the characters are relatable
    and lovable to true anime lovers around the 
    globe. I 100% recommend it!
</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba)</h3>
<p>
    As the name implies, it's an anime series on slaying demons.
    It goes hard on many levels and the main character could
    become a true life inspiration. It's very relatable and
    teaches some lessons if you are into deep stuff. It is
    action-packed as well and is a great watch.
